              <p>You might be thinking, why buy this instead of an apple watch or samsung gear?. We will just say this if you want to pay more for less than thats all you.The Star S-34 is our first ever smartwatch. 
                  We know simplicity is important so we did not make a complicated OS. This has your everyday feautures of texting, caling, maps, timer and everything you would find on a normal smartwatch. Thats where 
                  the similarities end. We have added an all new autofit feautre. Wearing a watch which does not fit right is a pain no one wants to face. Using cybernetic material, once you have put the watch on your hand 
                  the watch itself will tighten or loosen based on the size of your hand. Thats not enough?. Well we also have added submarine mode. Ever feel the urge to take high quality photod underwater with a watch. Well
                  you're welcome. We have added a camera which can operate perfectly underwater with a 64MP camera which will take crystal clear pictures underneath any form of water. This is the perfect teaser of the future.
